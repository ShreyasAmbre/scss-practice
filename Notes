*************Notes on SASS*******
1. setup
    -> Vscode
        -> Extension :- 1. Live Sass Compiler
                            -> go to setting-> sass-> format setting using json -> chnage savePath to "/dist/css
                        2. Live Server
    -> Create Project Folder
        SCSS
            dist
                index.html
            scss
                main.scss
    Note:- css folder will get created in dist folder after compilation 
    Note:- Everytime we should edit main.scss it will reflect in main.css in css folder

2. Variables :- we can create variable to store css property in that variable 
3. Maps :- it similar as object in js which has key:value pair
4. Nesting :- In this class can contain another element and we can assign scss property to it 
ex:- .div1{
        width: 80%;
        margin: 0 auto

        // p is a element inside div which has class .div1
        p{
            font-weight: map-get($font-weights, bold)
        }
    }
5. partials (small files ex:- _variable.scss:- contain ony varibales):- 
            dividing major scss file in small sperated specific files    
            Note: - uderscore at start of file name is compulsory otherwise sass compiler will create variable.css in css folder

6. function :- is similar to JS @function function_name(parameter) { @return statement }

7. mixins :- similar to function but, function are used to return values or compute values      
            mixins should difine styles

8. Extend :- It is use for inherit the parent class style to child class
